This project extract user info from WhatsApp and TrueCaller if the profile exists in any of the respective platforms.

To initiate, make sure you have python 3.8+ installed on your system.

For WhatsApp user data, I've used 'Apify', a web-scraping platform that also provides APIs for collecting data for various platforms.

For TrueCalle user data, I've used 'truecallerpy', a python module to search phone number details.

I've tabulated the data using 'tabulate', a python module for readable presentation of mixed textual and numeric data.

Replace the APIClient Token with your Personal Token.
